Simplicity is a wonderful ally to anyone embarking on a new project. This seems particularly true of a blog, which after all is a mostly text-based medium, with static images and links thrown in here and there. Blogging software should not be complex. So I was delighted to discover the remarkable simplicity of setting up a blog with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Blogging is one of the mass activities of the Internet: There are at least [18 million bloggers][nielsen-bloggers] worldwide. Companies and open-source development communities have created many ways to meet that demand, including a long line of blog-oriented social networks, point-and-click hosted solutions, and virtually code-free experiences from WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla for DIYers.

Jekyll plus GitHub Pages out-simples them all. No database. Minimum file tree. Literally up-and-running within a few minutes - with a few important caveats. 

Caveats: Don't do this if you hate your computer
------------------------------------------------

Run away from Jekyll if the thought of firing up a terminal and entering text commands to your computer gives you chills. You will have to use the command line, a version control system, and the software package system used in the Ruby programming language. You also will not be able to write your posts in a typical word processor like Microsoft Word. Jekyll posts are written in Markdown, a simple way to create headings, style text, create links, etc. You can easily learn what you need as you go, or you could start with an editor that will generate some of it for you, like [Hallo.js](http://hallojs.org/demo/markdown/).

On the other hand, at a time where technical skills are very much in demand, you could treat this as a very soft introduction to some of the tools used in software.

A tutorial on how to do this would be *totally* redundant, since both Jekyll and GitHub have incredible documentation. GitHub explains how to set up Jekyll to work on its free pages. Then, you can create a GitHub repository named your-user-name.github.io - and GitHub will automatically publish your blog to that web address.

As I go, I'll update this post to include what I am finding helpful in this process.

Other simple blogging solutions
-------------------------------

Jekyll is not the other static-site generator out there. Other people report liking [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), for example. So if Jekyll doesn't have what you need (for example, if you are not publishing a blog), there are similar tools out there that might.
